## Notes on Public Websites
Some E2E tests target real-world public job platforms.  
Due to dynamic DOM changes, region-based UI variations, and anti-bot measures, such sites can be unstable for deterministic automation.  
For portfolio purposes, stable demo applications are also used to clearly demonstrate automation concepts and QA best practices.
